So this is it, I'm on my easter break and with nothing else to procastinate I want to create this appplication
that will help me to detect "copy-paste" on word documents, mostly the motivation is to help on my duty as a 
tutor on my  social service, since I'm in contact with highschool students and sometimes I have to grade
essays and other homeworks, I feel that it would be easier to detect plagiarism if I had some sort of tool....
And so from there came the idea.


I will develop on python mostly because I feel it provides easier tools.... I still don't know where to begin
so for today the first task for myself will be to research how to read a word document using python (I feel 
that it has to do something with XML), and my second task is to research how to do web searches on google 
using python.

The basic idea is to take part of the essay on word and do a websearch on google and based on the percentage
of data that is found, determine if that piece of text is a copy paste or not......

Wellp hands on

After looking up on the internet for information I got this piece of code
https://gist.github.com/etienned/7539105

Thanks to the author, etienned, the piece of code of my program that reads
text from a word file will be inspired on his piece of code

well, now I have the component that reads the text from the input and puts it as raw text on an input

Things we still have to look up on this:
		- What to do when we have special characters, i.e letters that are not on the english alphabet


For tomorrow I will lookup how to do the internet search,
